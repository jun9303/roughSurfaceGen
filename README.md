# roughSurfaceGen

An artificial rough surface generator based on the algorithm by Forooghi et al. (2017, *J. Fluids Eng.*, doi:10.1115/1.4037280). This tool enables the creation and visualization of rough surfaces for research and engineering applications.

**Usage:**  
- In MATLAB (tested on R2023b or later), run `roughSurfGenScript` to generate and plot a rough surface using your specified input parameters.
- To identify a rough surface that best matches prescribed roughness properties (Ra, Rq, Rsk, Rku, etc.) via heuristic optimization, run `genAlgOptScript`. This script leverages MATLABâ€™s genetic algorithm; see [How it works](https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/how-the-genetic-algorithm-works.html) for more details.
