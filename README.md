# roughSurfaceGen

An artificial rough surface generator based on the algorithm by Forooghi et al. (2017, *J. Fluids Eng.*, doi:10.1115/1.4037280). This tool enables the creation and visualization of rough surfaces for research and engineering applications.

**Features**
- Generate artificial rough surfaces using established algorithms.
- Visualize generated surfaces directly in MATLAB.
- Optimize surface parameters (Ra, Rq, Rsk, Rku, etc.) to match target roughness statistics using a genetic algorithm.

**Getting Started**
- **MATLAB Compatibility:** Tested on MATLAB R2023b or later.
- **To Generate and Visualize a Surface:**  
  Run `roughSurfGenScript` in MATLAB. You can specify input parameters to control the characteristics of the generated surface.
- **To Optimize Surface Properties:**  
  Run `genAlgOptScript` to find a rough surface that best matches your prescribed roughness properties. This script uses MATLABâ€™s genetic algorithm toolbox. For more details, see [How the genetic algorithm works](https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/how-the-genetic-algorithm-works.html).
