# roughSurfaceGen

An artificial rough surface generator with sample results based on the algorithm provided by Forooghi et al. (2017, *J. Fluids Eng.*, [doi:10.1115/1.4037280](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4037280)).  

In MATLAB (tested on version R2023b or later), run `roughSurfGenScript` to generate and plot a rough surface with given input parameters. To search for the heuristically optimal rough surface that fits prescribed surface roughness properties (Ra, Rq, Rsk, Rku, etc.) using MATLABâ€™s genetic algorithm, run `genAlgOptScript` (*How it works*).
