## Abstract:
The widespread adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) has led to its application in a variety of engineering sectors. Representative of this is the fabrication of intricate mechanical parts such as gas turbine blades and guide vanes featuring complex internal cooling passages, where surface roughness induced during the AM process remains due to the difficulty in post-manufacturing surface treatment. As such, this paper investigates the impact of AM-induced surface roughness on flow characteristics within internal cooling passages. With the proper scale-up of models for attainable experiments and simulations, different artificial rough surface geometries mimicking the same realistic AM surface properties are generated and analyzed in both flat and ribbed channels modeling typical cooling passages. In flat channels, surface roughness introduces expected roughness effects in near-wall flow behaviors, validating the acquired data. In ribbed channels, where ribs represent conventional turbulators, the impact of surface roughness on surface friction and flow characteristics is found to be relatively marginal due to the presence of larger ribs. This indicates that the traditional rib turbulator design remains effective even with the AM process, arguably serving as a meaningful baseline to explore the expanded design space of efficient internal cooling offered by AM.
